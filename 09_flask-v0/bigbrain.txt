Q0 - We have seen similar syntax in java, when instantiating a class.
     For example, `ArrayList<> list = new ArrayList<String>()` creates an ArrayList object.

Q1 - David said that the '/' could be for files, because each branch of the file
     has another slash. For example ~/workshop/09_flask-v0. I said that it could also
     be the url, because each page has their own '/'.

Q2 - We weren't sure, David thought that it would print on the website, but I thought
     it might just be in the terminal, and I've seen some people use the syntax
     `if __name__ == '__main__':`, so I thought it'll print out '__main__'.

Q3 - David thought that it wouldnt print anything, because there was no code that
     used the returned value. I thought that the function returned the html data
     sent to the user, so it would show the text in the web browser if you go to the site.

Q4 - We haven't really seen similar constructs in other languages, unless it is
     referring to the '.' in `app.run()`, in which case it is the same as calling
     object methods in other languages.

After running it, it shows that it is `Serving Flask app 'app'` and that it is running
on the address 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' which is the localhost ip. When going to the url,
it shows the returned text. In addition, when opening the app, it prints '__main__' as
well as what seems to be the requests made to the server.
