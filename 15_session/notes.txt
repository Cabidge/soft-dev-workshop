-- GET vs POST
We don't exactly know the difference between GET and POST is.

Looking it up online we saw that POST was used for data submission and
processing, an example given was an HTML form. However, when we did our
assignment our method was GET which confuses us.

After some further research, we found the main differences between GET and POST
are how data is sent to the server and how it affects state.

GET requests have a query string at the end of the URL, in the following format:
url/to/site?name1=value1&key2=value2
and GET requests don't have any side effects, meaning no variables should change
based on the request and the state stays the same.

POST requests on the other hand usually sends data to the server in the request
body and it isn't saved in the URL. POST request also usually have side effects,
meaning they can update or create new variables and state may change, which is
useful for remembering whether a user is currently logged in or not.
