JSON is readable but is slow to parse and not space efficient

BSON == Binary JSON
	- Binary representation of JSON

BSON is fast and space efficient but not human readable

BSON also include dates and raw binary data types

JSON <=> BSON

`$ mongodump ...` == export BSON

`$ mongoexport ...` == export JSON

`$ mongorestore ...` == import BSON

`$ mongoimport ...` == import JSON

Queries must be valid JSON

Filter for documents with state:NY and city:ALBANY
	== {"state": "NY", "city": "ALBANY"}

Using find in the mongo shell:
	1. `$ show dbs`
	2. `$ use <database>`
	3. `$ show collections`
	4. `$ db.<collection>.find(<query>)`

Count how many zipcodes in NY: `$ db.zips.find({"state": "NY"}).count()`

Pretty print: `$ db.<collection>.find(<query>).pretty()`
