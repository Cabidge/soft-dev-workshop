The meta viewport tag in head makes it so the website is automatically adjusted based on the size of the device.

To style a button, you just add a btn class to the tag and a btn-[type] class to give it a color.
The button types are: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark, and link.
You can also instead add the btn-outline-[type] class for outline buttons instead.
Adding a btn-lg or btn-sm class will make the button large or small respectively.

A lot of different components interact with one another by giving the id of one
component as an attribute of another.
