Every document has a unique _id value

Documents can have the same exact fields and values (minus _id)

Documents can also be completely different from one another in shape

It isn't good practice however to do either of the two things above

`$ db.<collection>.findOne()` to get a document to get an idea of the shape

`$ db.<collection>.insert(<documents>)` to insert a document in the mongo shell

Inserting without an _id field, MongoDB automatically generates one

`$ ...insert(<docs>, { "ordered": false })` allows documents that don't
	have duplicate _id fields to be inserted without fault

`$ db.<new_collection>.insert(...)` creates a new collection if it doesn't exist

`$ use <new_collection>` also creates a new collection, but the collection
	won't actually be created until you actually use it, like insert
	into it

`$ db.<collection>.updateMany(<query>, {"$inc": {<field>: <value>}})` finds all
	documents that match the given <query> and increments their <field>
	by a given <value>

`$ ...updateOne(<query>, {"$set": {<field>: <value>}})` finds the first
	document matching the <query> and sets their <field> to <value>

`{"$push": {<field>: <value>}}` adds an element to an array field

`$ db.<collection>.deleteMany(<query>)` Deletes all documents matching <query>

`$ db.<collection>.drop()` Deletes an entire collection
