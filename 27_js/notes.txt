DISCO
console.log is like print in python.
console.log can print multiple arguments.
Semicolons optional.
Indentation doesn't matter.
for loops like c/java.
Ternary (? :) statements.
Arrow syntax (() =>) implicitly returns when you dont put curly braces.
const instead of var/let creates a constant value.

QCC
When should you use function over the arrow syntax? Does it matter?
